# Catanist - a Catan puzzle community
Puzzle game for catan, meant to help improve in catan decision making, kind of similar to Chess puzzle games. 


I started this project after finding myself wanting to practice catan game logic, but without wanting to commit to an entire game, as well as to develop specfic scenarios.
