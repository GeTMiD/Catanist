# Catanist - a Catan puzzle community
Puzzle game for catan, meant to help improve in catan decision making, in the spirit of Chess books&apps. 

I started this project after finding myself wanting to practice catan game logic, but without wanting to commit to an entire game, as well as to develop specfic scenarios.

I used this project as a way to hybrid manual development with vibe coding tools, the first quick front end deployment was done with loveable and then improved manually where needed.

Stack - 

Front End -  TypeScript, React - deployed with Vite
Backend - TBD, for now im experimenting with supabase
