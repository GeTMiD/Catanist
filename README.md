# Catanist - a Catan puzzle community
Puzzle game for catan, meant to help improve in catan decision making, in the spirit of Chess books&apps. 

I started this project after finding myself wanting to practice catan game logic, but without wanting to commit to an entire game, as well as to develop specfic scenarios.

I used this project as a way to test what I think the future of Web Development might look like - an abstraction of basic work with fine tuning where needed, so one developer is able to orchestrate a large application with many parts, mostly using different AI tools.
